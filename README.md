#### Hack Reactor Greenfield Project - Expense Splitting App

## Description
Divvying up expenses between friends and peers can be a disaster. Remember that time you went on a trip and one person rented the car and another paid for dinners and a third bought the gas and the beer and then you had to even-up while accounting for tips? Or that time rent was due but someone had purchased all of the groceries and utilities for the month? Enter Divvy.

Divvy allows users to enter expenses as they are incurred, and calculates the best way to settle the bill. No more painful math and messy payments to different people, Divvy simplifies everything down to one payment per person.
